This is a repository for the workflows and data from the phrynomics project. The phrynomics package is a separate suite of tools for SNP data. See [phrynomics](https://github.com/bbanbury/phrynomics)

## Files

We present all of the files in this repository to maximize open-source reproducibility. 

The phrynomicsFunctions.R file includes many custom functions that do not belong in the general phrynomics package. Many of these are hard coded for our particular datasets. These functions range from setting up analyses to scraping the results files for info. Some of these functions are deprecated and were only used during data exploration. 

The file phrynoSetup.R is the R script that we used to manipulate the phrynosoma SNP datasets we got out of pyRad.  This file includes (commented out) shell and perl scripts for running all our analyses on the UW cluster.
